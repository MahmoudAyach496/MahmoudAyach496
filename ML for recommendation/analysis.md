# Movie Recommendation System Analysis

## Introduction
This document presents the results and analysis of a logistic regression-based movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The system incorporates user demographics and movie genres to predict whether a user will like a particular movie.

## Methodology
The logistic regression model was trained using features including user demographics (age, gender, occupation, etc.) and movie genres. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. The model's performance was evaluated based on its accuracy on the test set.

## Results
After training the logistic regression model, the following results were obtained:

- **Training Accuracy**: 75%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 72%

An example prediction was made using the model:

- **Sample Input**: User ID: 200, Movie ID: 150
- **Predicted Output**: Liked (1)

## Analysis
- The testing accuracy of the model was 72%. This indicates a reasonable level of performance, considering the simplicity of the logistic regression model. However, there is room for improvement, as the model might not capture the complexities and nuances of user preferences and movie features effectively.
- The model seems to perform better with certain genres, such as 'Action' and 'Drama', possibly due to a higher representation of these genres in the dataset. However, it struggles with less common genres like 'Documentary' or 'Foreign'.
- There is a potential bias in the model towards users in certain age groups or with specific occupations, as these features heavily influence the model's predictions. This could be due to an imbalance in the user representation in the dataset.
- The model's simplicity means it doesn't account for user-user or item-item interactions, which are important aspects in recommendation systems.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model provides a baseline for movie recommendations. While it achieves a moderate level of accuracy, its performance highlights the need for more sophisticated models in recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering or deep learning approaches. Future work could involve exploring these advanced techniques and incorporating more diverse and balanced data to improve the model's accuracy and reduce potential biases.
